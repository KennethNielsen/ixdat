# Build documentation in the "docs/source/" directory with Sphinx
#   We would like move docs/source/conf.py to docs/conf.py, in order to
#   separate the structural stuff and the documentation source files,
#   but it seems that as of now it is a requirement that conf.py be in
#   the same folder as the main index.rst.
